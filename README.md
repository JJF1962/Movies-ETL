# Movies-ETL
##  Objective
The objective of this module was to learn how to use the Extract; Transform; Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines, an essential skill for Data Analysis.
as better detailed as follows:
##  Resources and main learning points
As described in the section 8.0.2 it was learned the following during this module and challenge 8
* Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
* Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
* Clean and transform data using Pandas.
* Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
* Load data with PostgreSQL.  (pgAdmin).
* In summary it was used Python, Pandas, ETL process, code refactoring, Postgress SQL(pgAdmin) and Git Hub.
##  Results
The resorces learned mentioned in the previous point were learned and allow us to execute four Deliveries:
* Deliverable 1: Write and ETL Function to read three data files 
We used the starter code  ETL-function-test.ipynb, renamed ETL_function_test.ipynb and we refactor de code in the execution of the challenge, firstly it was created a function to read in the three files and give it a name, in the second step consisted in to read the Kaggle Metadata and MovieLens ratings CSV files as Panda Dataframes, in the Step 3 open the Wikipedia JSON file and use the jason.load() function to convert it in to a raw data. In the following step it was used a code provided to return three DataFrames; in the step 6 we used the variables provide to create a path to Wilkipedia data, the Kaggle metadata and MoviLens rating data files, step 7 set the three variables equal to the function created in Step1 , step 8 Dataframes form the return statementand step 9-11 that all three files were converted to a tata frame as shown in the three figures below

* Deliverable 3: Extract and transfor the Kaggle Data
* Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
